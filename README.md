**PREPRINT**
This repository and website document all analyses, summaries, tables, and figures associated with the future preprint: "Longitudinal Modeling of Stomatal Conductance Potentiates the Optimization of Water-Use Efficient Maize."

**Data Availability**
Available scripts are ordered according to the research/manuscript trajectory.

**Script 1 relates to gas exchange data, averaging readings, merging with the field map, and validating data quality and structure**
1. averaging_merging_validation.R performs the following:
  Averages the raw data from 4 measurements per plot to 1 measurement per plot.
  Merges the averaged data with the field map data to combine it with hybrid names, replications, and field locations.
  Includes several validation steps at each stage to ensure raw data quality, structure, and proper integration with the field map data.
